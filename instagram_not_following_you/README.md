# This code shows who does not follow you in Instagram

You can get your following.json and followers.json files when you go to:

Your profile -> Settings -> Privacy and security -> Data Download.
After that you go in the folder followers_and_following and there you will find the 2 files.

Just put them in the directory of the main.py and see who does not follow you :)
